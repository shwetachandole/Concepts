# Concepts
Creating this repository to save notes about theoretical concepts in my areas of study, which currently include Data Science, Data analytics, Data engineering, BI engineering, Data architecture, Computational Science, Datastructures and Algorithms, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.
This is a broader list of topics of interests that I pursue on an everyday basis. This list may or may not be updated along the way.
